Library Levy Report (including overall improvement but also budget cuts) → 2012-2013
* The Seattle Public Library faced significant budget cuts in these years, which led to reduced funding for materials and services “for an estimated $5 million.”(4)


“For 2013, we face our fifth year of budget cuts, this time for an estimated $5 million. Without a levy, a cut of that size could mean shuttering five of the branches we invested in during Libraries for All and cutting the books and materials budget in half.” (Page 4)


While the 2012 budget cuts initially led to reduced services and potential declines in circulation, the subsequent approval and implementation of the 2012 Libraries Levy helped restore and enhance library services.
